3. Customer Churn Prediction

Project Description:
Developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn using telecom data. Identified key features driving customer churn and evaluated multiple classification models to improve prediction accuracy.

Key Features:
- Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, normalized data.
- Model Building: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and model evaluation.
- Visualization: Feature importance, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.

Tech Stack:
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
